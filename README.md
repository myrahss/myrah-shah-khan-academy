## About The Project

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I built this maze explorer game as a way to learn more about Object-Oriented Programming as well as using external libraries to build projects. The maze world is randomly generated for each play, and some key features include saving and replaying games, as well as shrinking the line of sight. I built this to make something fun with my skills and to learn!
